# To Do App

## Overview
This is a to-do app that lets a user make a list of tasks that he needs to complete on a daily basis or weekly. The app will let the user keep track of their chores. And once completed, it will be marked as“completed” and and can be updated also according to his program of the day. The user will be able to specify the expected date and time of each task and when (in minutes) and he will receive a prompt of his tasks through an email. The email will always contain a link to the task which will open when clicked. In completed tasks whose time has passed will be marked as skipped by a user. Users will also be able to delete their task.
